                <h1>Importance Of Learning Language</h1>
                <p>"One language, one person. Two languages, two people". Which means the more languages, the more people you can contact with. If you resolve to learn a language, it doesn't matter what language you learn, undoubtedly you won't just learn a language, but also you will learn how to communicate with people, what the right words to use, making people understand you without misunderstanding. As it is very important in the social life, it is also important in the business life. So, the process of learning will teach you thinking in analytical way and dealing with problems. But this is kind of tiring thing, so you will need consistency and this is the place where people who once tried to learn language but gave it up. Today, I am going to give you some advice to have fun while learning and ease your process of learning.</p>

                <h1>How To Learn Language</h1>
                <p>Now, let's talk about how to do it. First of all, most languages are separated into 5 pieces; Speaking, writing, listening, reading, vocabulary. These are the major parts of a language that you must pratice consistently. You have to embed the language you learn into your life. For example, you can convert the language of your pc or social media applications; if you watch or listen something, then you can watch and listen that thing in english. To scrutinize systematically, I will part this section into 5 pieces;</p>

            <div id="section5">
                <h1>Grammar</h1>
                <p>This is the place where the magic happens. Many people don't like this part of learning but I think this is one of the most important sections. Because in this section, you are building the foundations of the language structure. My suggestion is to start learning language by a general study book with explanations in your native language. This is the step to get familiar with the language. Because if you are absolute beginner, then the process can be overwhelming. After that, if you think that you are sufficient to make a dozen of sentences, you can have a look at other books which seem appropriate for you according to your level. But pay attention to this; do not jump from book to book. Just choose one, and carry on with it. Because most of the language grammar books have proper order. And I had better to emphasize this, you do not need to learn grammar rules during your learning process. After some time, you should allocate the time you spend on grammar to the time of reading or speaking or listening. By doing so, you will learn how to use the things that you learned in the sentence.</p>

                <h1>VOCABULARY</h1>
                <img src="images/vocabulary.jpg" alt="Vocabulary">
            </div>
            <div id="section7">
                <h1>Vocabulary</h1>
                <p>Of course, vocabulary is good but you will understand that it is more important in the advanced levels than you thought. Because as you go further, you will need more complicated and suitable words for your sentences. Here, I will give you some advice. First of all, do not dive into the vocabulary ocean with books. At the beginning, you should learn most common 100-200 words in that language. If you search this on the internet, you are likely to find too many resources which are free. Now, I have something to talk about; CEFR levels. Most likely, you may have heard levels such as A1, A2, B1, B2, C1 and C2. They are standard levels for European languages and make your learning easier because if you know your level and study vocabulary from one level above, then you can improve on that language by using the time efficiently. I suggest that learn the next most common 2000-3000 beginner and intermediate words which are in A1, A2, B1 and B2 levels. At the end, you can learn 2000 advanced words in C1 and C2 levels. For other languages, you can try to find the level system of that language and make your moves according to that system. For example, in Japanese the levels are N5, N4, N3, N2 and N1 from beginner to advanced.</p>

                <h1>WATCHING<br>AND<br>LISTENING</h1>

            <div id="section9">
                <h1>Watching And Listening</h1>
                <p>As you go further, you will learn too many rules, words, idioms and so on. But, when you see you can not gather the things you learned together properly, you can get upset. Although you study and read regularly, you may not know when to use specific words and chunks. There is only one way to cope with this situation; watching and listening. You have to perceive that knowledge by your senses. Think about that, how do babies learn their native language. The answer is hearing, listening something from their parents. So, you need to listen frequently and be exposed to that language. To do this, you can use movies and TV series. By making use of movies and series, you will not just listen, but also you will pay attention to the body language and learn which idioms and words to use in specific occasions. Also, you can search for podcasts. While having your breakfast, you can listen a podcast which is appropriate with your interests.</p>

                <h1>SPEAKING</h1>

            <div id="section11">
                <h1>Speaking</h1>
                <p>Speaking is one of the most hardest things in the language learning process. It is hard not because of its difficulty, but because of difficulty of finding somebody to talk. Here, I am going to give you one or two platforms to use and if you use them efficciently, you will improve your speaking in a very short time. First of all, you have to be confident. To be confident, i recommend you to use <a href="https://www.free4talk.com/">Free4Talk</a>. This platform is free and full of speakers who are beginner or intermediate. You can spend your first month in this platform. After that, you have to switch to the <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a>. You may assume Discord is just for gaming but it is not really. You can find too many servers to find somebody to talk. But do not attend the language learning servers. Just go with chat servers in which people speak your aim language. By doing so, you will reach the native people.</p>

                <h1>READING</h1>
                <img src="images/reading.jpg" alt="Reading">
            </div>
            <div id="section13">
                <h1>Reading</h1>
                <p>As we can expect, language learning makes reading necessary. At this part, you don't have to do anything specifically. Presumably, you read something in your daily life. All you need to do is reading whatever you read in the focus language. For example, before sleeping you may read book for 30 minutes or you can get a book which is full of articles on different subject. This also was the book with which i improved my language logic while learning. But, it doesn't mean you need to get that kind of book. Here is my advice, get a book based on your interests. For instance, you are interested in chess and you wanted to learn Russian, then buy a book that teaches different techniques in chess or if you are into technology, go with books about algorithm, artificial intelligence etc... And sometimes, you will be fed up with reading. You are right, language learning is something like marathon. So, you will get tired of learning and not want to do anything. Just be patient because at the end of the run, you will be able to communicate and interact with millions of people.</p>
